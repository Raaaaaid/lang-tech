\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
	\item What is your research goal/the research question you are trying to answer?
	\item Is there any previous/related work?
	\item What are the necessary steps (research plan)? How will those be distributed among 	team members?
	\item What data will you use? What preprocessing steps are necessary? Do you need to annotate the data? How will this be done? Manually? With the assistance of e.g. GPT-3?
	\item What will be the train-validation-test split? How do you prevent train-test leakage?
	\item Are there baseline datasets or baseline methods for your approach that you will compare your results to?
	\item Will you train a new model? Will you use an existing model architecture/a pretrained model? Finetuning, head retraining?
	\item What experiments will you conduct? What will be the evaluation methods/quality criteria/metrics?
	\item How will you be able to answer the research question based on those experiments?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-5pt}
	\item The cleaned up/refined dataset (if you release data, provide a datasheet https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010)
	\item The trained model (if you release a model, provide a model card https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)
	\item For shared tasks: A task description and evaluation scripts
	\item Evaluation results and plots
	\item Visualizations and/or interactive demonstrations (if applicable - specify what and in which suitable format)
